# Deep Learning with Multiple Objectives

Welcome to the lab! We will explore hands-on what is missing in deep learning. There will be three parts: Stationary World, Dynamical World, and Project.

In this course, we will delve into one area of limitations of the current incarnation of deep learning technologies, while being optimistic about what is already possible.

There will be three separate modules. In the **first module** of the course, we will focus on learning in a stationary setting where the neural network learns each objective at the same time.  to We will have multiple competing objectives. Investigating this, we will better understand how deep neural networks are trained, and what are some limitations.

In the **second module**, we will focus on life-long learning. How do we learn over course of multiple tasks? This seems to be a necessary capability on the path to artificial general intelligence. 

In the **third module**, we highlight several solutions, most likely focusing on meta-learning, modularity (including computational computation). These two solutions were shown to help deep network learn multiple objectives both in the sequential and stationary setting.


## Requirements

* Completing Machine Learning or Neural Networks course, or **demonstration** of equivalent knowledge

## Lab

* Approximately 50% of our labs will be devoted to working on a project and consulting it throughout the semester. 

* You will be working on the project in groups of 2-3. 

* We will try to use gather.town. Your feedback is essential: we can switch to teams if you prefer. Why gather.town:

    - Easy pernament whiteboard
    
    - Easy to see where I am during consultation
    
    - Easy to ask question privately

## Project and Mini-Project

* Your grade will largely depend on completing a Project and a Mini-Project 

* The Mini-Project will focus on Transfer Learning

    * Topics for the Mini-Project will be announced later
    
    * Preferred topic is using GPT-2, Vision Transformer, or CLIP in some context
    
        - See [this list][https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ldc6oc/p_list_of_sitesprogramsprojects_that_use_openais/] for inspiration

* The Project will be carried out in groups of 2 to 3 students

    * Topics for the Project will be announced later
    
    * Preferred topic is reproducing a highly cited or accepted into a prestigious conference paper that addresses any of the challenges
    discussed in this course


## Attendance

- Attending labs is required (2 abstences are OK, more are of course possible but please reach out with an explanation)

- Attending lectures is optional


## Grading

Your grade will be based on:

- (~20%) Completing a few small exercises (3-4) including reading papers. 

    Exercises have to be submitted by Thursday midnight via email.

- (~20%) Miniproject 1: We will together work on a specific topic and explore few ideas around it that illustrate concepts in Stationary World

- (~60%) Project

Your grade will calculates as follows:

* 0-49%: 2

* 50-59%: 3

* 60-69%: 3,5

* 70-79%: 4

* 80-89%: 4,5

* 90-100%: 5


## Compute

* You will need at least a single GPU. Google's Colab seems to be the best option

  - Paperspace looks interesting but I found it has a very long startup time.
